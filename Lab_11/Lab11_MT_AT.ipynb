Esto se logra de forma autosupervisada, necesitando solo unos pocos ejemplos para cada API.  Toolformer decide qué APIs llamar, cuándo llamarlas, qué argumentos pasar y cómo incorporar los resultados en la predicción de tokens futuros.  Se incorporan varias herramientas, incluyendo una calculadora, un sistema de preguntas y respuestas, un motor de búsqueda, un sistema de traducción y un calendario.  Las evaluaciones muestran que Toolformer mejora sustancialmente el rendimiento en cero disparos en diversas tareas, a menudo compitiendo con modelos mucho más grandes, sin sacrificar sus capacidades básicas de modelado del lenguaje.  El documento también analiza las limitaciones del método, como la incapacidad de usar herramientas en cadena o de forma interactiva, y la ineficiencia en el muestreo de datos para ciertas APIs.\n",

A diferencia de enfoques previos que requieren grandes cantidades de anotaciones humanas o limitan el uso de herramientas a entornos específicos, Toolformer aprende de forma autosupervisada con solo unos pocos ejemplos para cada API.  Incorpora una variedad de herramientas, incluyendo una calculadora, un sistema de preguntas y respuestas, un motor de búsqueda, un sistema de traducción y un calendario.  Los experimentos demuestran que Toolformer, basado en un modelo GPT-J preentrenado con 6.7B parámetros, logra un rendimiento significativamente mejorado en varias tareas, a menudo competitivo con modelos mucho más grandes, sin sacrificar sus capacidades básicas de modelado del lenguaje.  El enfoque se basa en la capacidad de aprendizaje en contexto de los grandes modelos de lenguaje para generar conjuntos de datos completos desde cero.  Se muestra que el modelo decide autónomamente qué APIs llamar, cuándo llamarlas, qué argumentos pasar y cómo incorporar mejor los resultados en la predicción de tokens futuros.  Se evalúa en diversas tareas, incluyendo LAMA, conjuntos de datos matemáticos, preguntas y respuestas, preguntas y respuestas multilingües y conjuntos de datos temporales, demostrando mejoras significativas en el rendimiento de cero-disparo.  Finalmente, se discuten las limitaciones del enfoque, como la incapacidad de usar herramientas en cadena o de forma interactiva, y la ineficiencia en el muestreo de datos para ciertas APIs.\\n'"

        "*Respuesta:* Al analizar el grafico \"Tamaño del Contexto vs Tiempo de Respuesta\", se observa que el tamano de los chunks influye significativamente en el desempeno del RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). Cuando los chunks son mas grandes, se reduce la cantidad de fragmentos generados, lo que puede agilizar el proceso de busqueda y reducir el tiempo de respuesta. Sin embargo, si los chunks son demasiado grandes, podrian incluir informacion irrelevante, disminuyendo la precision de las respuestas. Por otro lado, cuando los chunks son pequenos, se genera un mayor numero de fragmentos, lo que aumenta la granularidad de la busqueda pero puede incrementar el tiempo de respuesta debido a la necesidad de procesar mas datos.\n",

        "Cuando se devuelven muchos chunks, el modelo puede recibir un contexto excesivamente largo, aumentando el tiempo de respuesta y posiblemente superando el limite de tokens manejado por el modelo. En cambio, si se devuelven pocos chunks, el contexto podria ser insuficiente para generar respuestas completas o precisas.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finalmente, el tipo de busqueda (similarity vs mmr) tambien afecta los resultados. La busqueda por similarity tiende a devolver los documentos mas cercanos en terminos de embeddings, mientras que MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) prioriza la diversidad en los resultados. Esto ultimo puede ser util para evitar redundancias en las respuestas, pero podria aumentar el tiempo de procesamiento debido al calculo adicional necesario para garantizar la diversidad."

These prompts are diverse, including generation, question answering, dialogue, summarization, extraction, and other natural language tasks.  The dataset is over 96% English.  Labeler-written prompts were also used to bootstrap the process.  These were categorized as \"Plain,\" \"Few-shot,\" and \"User-based.\"  The dataset was filtered for personally identifiable information (PII).  Table 1 shows the distribution of use-case categories for the API prompts, and Table 2 shows illustrative prompts.  More details on dataset sizes are in Table 6 and Appendix A.\n",

Further details on prompt lengths are provided in Tables 8, 9, and 10 in Appendix A.3 and A.4.  The language breakdown of the dataset is discussed in Appendix A.4, showing that 96% is English, with a small minority of prompts in other languages.\n",

A screening test was used to select labelers sensitive to the preferences of different demographic groups and good at identifying potentially harmful outputs.  Appendix B provides more details on the selection procedure and labeler demographics.  Inter-annotator agreement rates are reported in Section 3.4.\n",

Details on the training procedures for each are provided in Section 3.5 and Appendix C.  Baselines included SFT models, GPT-3, and GPT-3 with a few-shot prompt.

Section 3.6 and Appendix D provide further details on the evaluation procedures and metrics.  Table 3 shows labeler-collected metadata on the API distribution.\n",
